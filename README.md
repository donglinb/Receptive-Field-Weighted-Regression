# Receptive-Field-Weighted-Regression
An implementation of Receptive Field Weighted Regression.  
The implementation is based on the following paper:  
[1] Schaal, S. & Atkeson, C. G. (1997). Receptive Field Weighted Regression. Technical Report TR-H-209, ATR Human Information Processing Laboratories, 2-2 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gu, Kyoto 619-02, Japan.  
The demo is a curve fitting program, using RFWR to fit a complicated 2-D function. The demo depends on the Eigen3 and matio library.
